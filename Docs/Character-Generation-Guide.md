2. Use Rive editor for interactive animations
3. Use Blender/Maya for video animations
4. Create idle, speaking, and emotional animations

### **Step 3: Integrate into Flutter**
1. Add animation files to `assets/characters/`
2. Update `pubspec.yaml` to include assets
3. Use `ExternalCharacterService` to display characters
4. Implement character-specific animations

### **Step 4: Optimize Performance**
1. Compress animation files
2. Use appropriate formats for different use cases
3. Test on various devices
4. Implement lazy loading for large files

## 💡 **RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **For Quick Start (RECOMMENDED)**:
1. **Use Ready Player Me** for character generation
2. **Use Lottie** for animations (smallest file sizes)
3. **Create 4 characters** with consistent style
4. **Generate 3-4 animations per character**

### **For Professional Quality**:
1. **Use Character Creator 4** for character generation
2. **Use Rive** for interactive animations
3. **Create detailed character sheets**
4. **Generate 5-6 animations per character**

### **For Maximum Quality**:
1. **Use MetaHuman Creator** for character generation
2. **Use Video** for complex animations

4. **Integrate into Flutter** using the provided service
5. **Test and optimize** for performance

This approach will give you **professional-quality, human-like characters** that are much better than anything we could create in Flutter!
