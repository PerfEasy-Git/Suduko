## 📱 Mobile-Specific Considerations

### 1. Screen Sizes

**Target Devices:**
- Small: iPhone SE (4.7") - 750x1334
- Medium: iPhone 13 (6.1") - 1170x2532
- Large: iPhone 14 Pro Max (6.7") - 1290x2796
- Tablet: iPad (9.7"+)

**Design Strategy:**
- Responsive layouts using MediaQuery
- Minimum tap target: 44x44 pts (iOS) / 48x48 dp (Android)
- Safe area handling (notches, home indicators)

### 2. Orientation

**Primary:** Portrait Only (MVP)
- Natural for Sudoku (9x9 grid)
- Better for reading story
- One-handed play

**Future:** Landscape for tablets

### 3. Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Critical |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Frame Rate** | 60 FPS | Always |
| **Cold Start** | < 2s | On fast devices |
| **Memory** | < 150 MB | During gameplay |
| **Battery** | < 5%/hour | With screen on |

### 4. Offline Capability

**Must Work Offline:**
- ✅ Puzzle generation
- ✅ Classic mode (full)
- ✅ Story mode (if cached)
- ✅ Progress saving

**Requires Online:**
- ❌ Daily challenge
- ❌ Cloud sync
- ❌ Leaderboards (future)

**Strategy:** Offline-first with background sync

---

## 🎨 Mobile UI/UX Principles

### 1. Touch-First Design

**Grid Interaction:**
- Large tap targets (cells should be 40-50 pts minimum)
- Visual feedback (highlight on touch)
- Haptic feedback on selection
- Swipe gesture support (future)

**Number Pad:**
- Bottom of screen (thumb zone)
- Single-tap entry
- Long-press for notes
- Clear visual states

### 2. One-Handed Operation

**Thumb Zones:**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Hard to reach  │  ← Top (avoid important actions)
│                 │
│    OK Zone      │  ← Middle (content)
│                 │
│  Easy to reach  │  ← Bottom (main controls)
└─────────────────┘
```

**Design Decisions:**
- Number pad at bottom
- Back button top-left (standard)
- Settings/menu top-right
- Game controls: bottom bar

### 3. Gesture Support

**MVP Gestures:**
- Tap: Select cell
- Tap: Enter number
- Tap: Deselect

**Future Gestures:**
- Swipe: Navigate between puzzles
- Long-press: Quick notes
- Pinch: Zoom (accessibility)
