# 📚 StoryDoku - Documentation Index & Executive Summary

**Project:** StoryDoku - Story-Driven Sudoku Mobile Game  
**Version:** 1.0 (MVP Documentation)  
**Theme:** Codebreakers (Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk)  
**Platform:** Flutter (iOS + Android)  
**Target Launch:** 13 weeks from start  
**Last Updated:** October 22, 2025

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**StoryDoku** is a groundbreaking mobile game that reinvents Sudoku by combining it with compelling narrative storytelling. Unlike traditional Sudoku apps that offer endless, emotionless puzzles, StoryDoku makes every puzzle matter by tying it to a larger story arc.

### The Opportunity
- **Market Gap:** No deep story-Sudoku integration exists
- **Proven Demand:** Puzzle adventures (Professor Layton, Monument Valley) have strong following
- **Low Entry Cost:** ~$500-700 for 6 months (MVP)
- **Scalable Model:** Episodic content, subscription potential

### The Vision
> "We're not just solving numbers; we're decoding narratives."

Players don't just complete puzzles—they **unlock memories, make choices, and shape the story** as they progress through chapters of a sci-fi mystery about humanity's relationship with AI.

## 🏁 Final Notes

This documentation represents a **complete blueprint** for building StoryDoku from scratch to launch. Every major decision has been documented, every system has been designed, and every week of development has been planned.

### What Makes This Different

Most app projects fail because of:
- ❌ Unclear vision
- ❌ Poor planning
- ❌ Technical debt
- ❌ Scope creep
- ❌ Budget overruns

StoryDoku's documentation addresses all of these:
- ✅ Clear, compelling vision
- ✅ Week-by-week roadmap
- ✅ Clean architecture design
- ✅ Well-defined MVP scope
- ✅ Realistic budget (<$1K)

### The Path Forward

You now have everything needed to build a professional, scalable, story-driven Sudoku game. The question isn't "Can this be built?" but rather "When do we start?"
